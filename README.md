# Broke-Chain-Cloud
This is the start of what might be a decentralized cloud computing experience

Introduction

In a world where everyone is talking about building operating systems, we present BrokeChain Cloud OS â€“ an ambitious project that aims to redefine decentralized cloud computing. Inspired by the visionaries who dared to build something unique, our goal is to create an operating system that operates on the testnet for free.
Project Highlights

    Decentralization: BrokeChain Cloud OS is purely decentralized, providing a new paradigm for cloud computing.
    Divide and Conquer: Our approach involves breaking down large files into hexadecimals for enhanced security and encryption.
    Memory Allocation Algorithm: Every operating system needs an efficient memory allocation algorithm. Check out our innovative approach in the screenshots.

Features

    File Uploads: We address the challenges of file uploads by developing our compression algorithms and exploring blockchain alternatives.
    Video Inspiration: Watch the video from "Halt and Catch Fire" where someone talks about building a machine no one else has the courage to build.
